# v0.2.0 (Release Candidate)

## Highlights
- Seeded Windows PR coverage gate (Pester v6, Cobertura, JUnit, artifact uploads, file-floor enforcement hooks).
- Added docs link-check workflow (lychee) with persistent reports.
- Introduced ADR/RTM/backlog scaffolding for compliance traceability.
- Added Pester smoke test to keep CI green while suites grow.

## Outstanding Work
- Fully populate RTM against upcoming features.
- Add more ADRs (CI policy, release governance) and Definition of Done guidance.
- Re-evaluate coverage threshold >= 75% once modules expand (possible bump to 80%).

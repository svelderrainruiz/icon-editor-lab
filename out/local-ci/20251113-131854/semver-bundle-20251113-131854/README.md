# SemVer Bundle

This bundle was generated by 	ools/Export-SemverBundle.ps1 on 2025-11-13T13:20:39.4082688-08:00.

Included artifacts:

1. src/tools/priority/validate-semver.mjs — Node script that validates the repository version field.
2. docs/semver-guard-kit.md — step-by-step instructions for adopting the SemVer guard + Node pin in other repos.
3. docs/semver-node-evidence.md — evidence log showing the guard in action inside icon-editor-lab.

## Quick start

`powershell
npm install
npm run semver:check
`

Make sure the target repository pins Node 20 ("engines": { "node": ">=20.11.0" }) and uses ctions/setup-node@v4 in CI before running the script.

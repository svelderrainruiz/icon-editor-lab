# CI Workflow (Multi-Channel Release Support)

This guide explains how to automate build, test, and distribution steps for the **LabVIEW Icon Editor** using GitHub Actions—**with multiple pre-release channels** (Alpha, Beta, RC), optional hotfix branches, and a toggleable **Development Mode** feature. It is designed to align with **Gitflow** practices, allowing you to enforce a hands-off approach where merges flow naturally from `develop` → `release-alpha` → `release-beta` → `release-rc` → `main`, while also ensuring forks can reuse the same build scripts.

## 1. Introduction

Automating your LabVIEW Icon Editor builds and releases offers several benefits:

- **Gitflow alignment**: merges flow from feature → develop → (alpha/beta/rc) → main without manual toggles.  
- **Label-based semantic versioning** (`major`, `minor`, `patch`).  
- **Multiple pre-release channels** (Alpha/Beta/RC) via dedicated branch names.  
- **Commit-based build number** appended as `-build<commitCount>`.  
- **Hotfix branches** for urgent final patch releases.  
- **Development Mode** toggle if you need LabVIEW to reference local source code directly for debugging.

This workflow ensures that all **forks** of the repository can sync the latest build scripts from upstream (e.g., NI) and follow the same rules. If you keep your fork up to date, you benefit from any bug fixes or improvements made in the original repo.

## 2. Quickstart / Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Set up `.github/workflows`**
   Ensure the following workflows exist (or adapt names as needed):
   - `development-mode-toggle.yml` (Development Mode Toggle)
   - `ci-composite.yml` (CI Pipeline (Composite); includes the **Build VI Package** job)

2. **Configure Permissions**
   - In **Settings → Actions → General**, set **Workflow permissions** to allow the workflow to read repository contents and upload artifacts.

3. **Make a Pull Request and Label It**
   - Apply at most one of `major`, `minor`, or `patch` to request a version bump. If no label is present, the workflow defaults to a patch bump. The workflow fails only if multiple release labels are applied. See [`compute-version`](../.github/actions/compute-version/action.yml) for details.

4. **Merge to the Appropriate Branch**
   - In Gitflow, typical merges go from **feature** → **develop**, then eventually to:
     - **`release-alpha/*`** for early testing (`-alpha.<N>`),  
     - **`release-beta/*`** for later testing (`-beta.<N>`),  
     - **`release-rc/*`** for near-final (`-rc.<N>`),  
     - and finally **main** for a final release (no suffix).  
   - Alternatively, **`hotfix/*`** merges can go directly to **main** for quick patches.

5. **Check Build Artifacts**
   - The `.vip` file is generated and uploaded as a build artifact.
   - If you want to publish a GitHub Release, create one manually and upload the artifact.

6. **Optionally Enable Development Mode**
   - If you need LabVIEW to reference local source directly, run the **Development Mode Toggle** workflow (see [Development Mode](#31-development-mode)). Usually, you **disable** it for standard builds/tests.

For a visual reference, you may consult a **Gitflow diagram** that includes alpha/beta/rc branches as an extension of the typical `release/` branch. This helps illustrate how merges flow between `develop` and `main`.

## 3. Getting Started and Configuration

<a name="31-development-mode"></a>
### 3.1 Development Mode

**Development Mode** configures LabVIEW for local debugging or specialized project setups. It often involves modifying `labview.ini` so LabVIEW references local source code. You can **enable** or **disable** it as needed:

- **Enable**:
  - Run the **Development Mode Toggle** workflow with `mode=enable` (or manually call `Set_Development_Mode.ps1`).
- **Disable**:
  - Run the workflow with `mode=disable` (or call `RevertDevelopmentMode.ps1`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When Development Mode is **enabled**, you generally can’t test the final `.vip` install properly (since LabVIEW might be pointing to local source). Always **disable** dev mode before attempting a final install or distribution test.

<a name="32-self-hosted-runner-setup"></a>
### 3.2 Self-Hosted Runner Setup

For **detailed runner configuration**, see **`runner-setup-guide.md`**. Below is a short summary:

1. **Install Prerequisites**
   - **LabVIEW 2021 SP1** (32-bit and 64-bit) plus **LabVIEW 2023** (as needed for packaging)
   - **PowerShell 7+**
   - **Git for Windows**
2. **Add a Self-Hosted Runner**  
   - Go to **Settings → Actions → Runners**. Follow GitHub’s steps to register a Windows runner on your machine with LabVIEW installed.  
3. **Label Your Runner**  
   - For example, use `self-hosted-windows-lv` (or `self-hosted-linux-lv` for Linux). Ensure your workflow’s `runs-on` references these labels.

## 4. Available CI Workflows

Below are the **two** key workflows. Each one is defined in its own `.yml` file.

<a name="41-development-mode-toggle"></a>
### 4.1 Development Mode Toggle

You’ll typically name the workflow file **`development-mode-toggle.yml`**. Its purpose is to **enable** or **disable** a “development mode” on a self-hosted runner that has LabVIEW installed.

<a name="411-overview"></a>
#### 4.1.1 Overview

**What Is “Development Mode”?**  
- A specialized state for LabVIEW-centric projects, where LabVIEW is configured to load code from local source paths (or apply certain debugging tokens in `labview.ini`).  
- This mode often prevents installing the final `.vip` for normal testing—so you’ll want to toggle it **off** once you finish coding or debugging.

**Purpose of This Workflow**  
- Lets collaborators quickly switch a self-hosted runner into/out of dev mode.  
- Often triggered **manually** (via `workflow_dispatch`) or by other workflows (via `workflow_call`).  
- Simplifies toggling environment state without manual steps each time.

<a name="412-usage"></a>
#### 4.1.2 Usage

1. **Trigger Manually**  
   - Go to the **Actions** tab, select the “Development Mode Toggle” workflow, click “Run workflow.”  
   - Choose `enable` or `disable` to run the corresponding PowerShell script (`Set_Development_Mode.ps1` or `RevertDevelopmentMode.ps1`).  
   - The workflow runs on your self-hosted runner (e.g., labeled `self-hosted-windows-lv`).

2. **Important Note for Testing**  
   - With dev mode **enabled**, LabVIEW references local code, so installing the `.vip` may fail or cause conflicts.  
   - After coding, **disable** dev mode before building or testing the final package.

3. **Trigger from Another Workflow**  
   - You can call this workflow using `workflow_call`. Pass the input parameter `mode` = `enable` or `disable`.  
   - The same runner used by the calling job is toggled accordingly.

<a name="413-examples-calling-this-workflow"></a>
#### 4.1.3 Examples: Calling This Workflow

**A) Call from Another Workflow in the Same Repository**  
```yaml
name: "My Other Workflow"
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  call-dev-mode:
  runs-on: self-hosted-windows-lv
    steps:
      - name: Invoke Dev Mode Toggle (enable)
        uses: ./.github/workflows/development-mode-toggle.yml
        with:
          mode: enable
```

**B) Call from Another Repository**  
```yaml
name: "Cross-Repo Dev Mode Toggle"
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  remote-dev-mode:
  runs-on: self-hosted-windows-lv
    steps:
      - name: Use remote Dev Mode Toggle
        uses: <owner>/<repo>/.github/workflows/development-mode-toggle.yml@main
        with:
          mode: disable
```

**C) Call from a Fork**  
```yaml
name: "Forked Dev Mode Example"
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  forked-workflow-call:
  runs-on: self-hosted-windows-lv
    steps:
      - name: Call Dev Mode Toggle from My Fork
        uses: <your-fork>/<repo>/.github/workflows/development-mode-toggle.yml@my-feature-branch
        with:
          mode: enable
```

<a name="414-customization"></a>
#### 4.1.4 Customization

All dev-mode logic resides in two PowerShell scripts:

- **`Set_Development_Mode.ps1`** – Called when mode is `enable`.  
- **`RevertDevelopmentMode.ps1`** – Called when mode is `disable`.

<a name="42-ci-pipeline-composite"></a>
### 4.2 CI Pipeline (Composite)

 - **File Name**: `ci-composite.yml`
 - **Purpose**: A dedicated **version** job (using `compute-version`) derives the version from PR labels and commit count, and the **Build VI Package** job builds the `.vip` artifact using that version output.
- **Features**:
    - **Issue status gating**: skips most jobs unless the branch name contains `issue-<number>` (e.g., `issue-123`, `feature/issue-123`) and the linked issue has Status **In Progress**.
    - **Label-based** version bump (`major`, `minor`, `patch`); unlabeled pull requests
      default to `patch` (see `.github/actions/compute-version/action.yml`, used by
      `compute-version` in `ci-composite.yml`).
    - **Commit-based build number**: `vX.Y.Z-build<commitCount>` (plus optional pre-release suffix).
    - **Multi-Channel** detection for `release-alpha/*`, `release-beta/*`, `release-rc/*`.
    - **Upload Artifact**: Builds the `.vip` file and uploads it as a workflow artifact (no automatic GitHub Release attachment).
- **Events**: Typically triggered on:
  - Push or PR to `main`, `develop`, `release-alpha/*`, `release-beta/*`, `release-rc/*`, `feature/*`, `hotfix/*`, or `issue-*`.
    The workflow explicitly lists these pre-release patterns and does **not** use a generic `release/*` trigger.
  - Might also be triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`) if needed.

## 5. Gitflow Branching and Versioning

<a name="51-branching-overview"></a>
### 5.1 Branching Overview

**Gitflow** typically involves:
- **`develop`**: main integration branch for ongoing development.  
- **`feature/*`**: branches off `develop` for individual features.  
- **`release/*`**: branched off `develop` when nearing release.  
- **`hotfix/*`**: branched off `main` for urgent fixes.  

In this repo, we extend the concept of `release/*` into **`release-alpha/*`, `release-beta/*`, and `release-rc/*`** to differentiate pre-release stages. The CI workflow mirrors this by triggering on these exact patterns. Merges flow as:
- **feature** → **develop** → **release-alpha/X.Y** → **release-beta/X.Y** → **release-rc/X.Y** → **main**.

<a name="52-multi-channel-pre-releases"></a>
### 5.2 Multi-Channel Pre-Releases

Branches named:
- **`release-alpha/*`** → produces a version suffix `-alpha.<N>`.  
- **`release-beta/*`** → produces a version suffix `-beta.<N>`.  
- **`release-rc/*`** → produces a version suffix `-rc.<N>`.  

Merging into these branches (or pushing directly to them) triggers a **pre-release build**. After final testing in `release-rc/*`, merging into **main** yields a stable release without any suffix.

<a name="53-hotfix-branches"></a>
### 5.3 Hotfix Branches

- **`hotfix/*`** merges produce a **final** release (no `-rc`, `-alpha`, or `-beta`).  
- Typically, you merge hotfix branches directly into **main** and then back into **develop** to keep them in sync.

<a name="54-version-bumps-via-labels"></a>
### 5.4 Version Bumps via Labels

When you open a **Pull Request** into `develop`, `release-alpha/*`, or `release-beta/*` (or even `main`/`hotfix/*`):
- Apply at most one of the labels `major`, `minor`, or `patch` to increment the corresponding version segment (e.g., `1.2.3` → `2.0.0` if `major`, etc.).
- If multiple release labels are applied, the workflow fails. When no release label is present, it defaults to a patch bump. See [`compute-version`](../.github/actions/compute-version/action.yml) for implementation details.

> **Note**: This means you can version-bump **incrementally** while merging into `develop` (to reflect that new features are in development), or you can wait until you merge to a pre-release branch. Each time the build runs, the resulting `.vip` has an updated version (with a new build number, plus any alpha/beta/rc suffix if applicable).

<a name="55-build-number"></a>
### 5.5 Build Number

- Determined by **`git rev-list --count HEAD`**.  
- Appended as `-build<commitCount>` in the final version string.  
- Always strictly the commit count—no overrides by default.

<a name="6-branch-protection--contributing"></a>
## 6. Branch Protection and Contributing

In order to **enforce** the Gitflow approach “hands-off”:
1. **Enable Branch Protection Rules**:  
   - For example, protect `main`, `release-alpha/*`, `release-beta/*`, and `release-rc/*` so that only approved Pull Requests can be merged, preventing direct pushes.  
   - Require the **Build VI Package** job from the CI Pipeline (Composite) workflow to pass before merging.
2. **Refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md`**:  
   - Document your team’s policies on how merges flow from feature → develop → alpha/beta/rc → main.  
   - Outline any required approvals or code reviews.  

> **Only the original (upstream) repo** typically **enforces** these rules. Forks may choose to adopt them but are not forced to. However, if you submit a PR **upstream**, you’ll need to comply with the branch protections in place there.

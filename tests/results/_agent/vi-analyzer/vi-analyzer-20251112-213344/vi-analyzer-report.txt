MissingInProject.vi (C:\codex\home\runner\work\icon-editor-lab\vendor\icon-editor\.github\actions\missing-in-project\MissingInProject.vi)
Control Alignment	The controls on this VI's front panel are not arranged in a manner similar to their locations on the connector pane (right).  A VI is more self-documenting when its front panel arrangement matches that of its connector pane.
VI Documentation	This VI has no VI Description.
Spell Check	This VI contains the misspelled word "MissingInProject" in its name.
Comment Usage	This block diagram contains fewer than 1 comment.
Wire Crossings	This wire has 6 crossing(s)  which is more than the user specified maximum (5). The test was configured with 3 maximum fixed number of crossings and 2 maximum number of crossings per sink.
Enabled Debugging	This VI has debugging enabled, which can reduce performance slightly.  Consider disabling debugging in the VI Properties >> Execution dialog box for this VI.

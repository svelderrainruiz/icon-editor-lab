# ADR-0001: Adopt Multi-Agent Orchestration

Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-11-10

## Context
We will use lightweight, non-destructive automation to curate repo structure, CI gates, and documentation scaffolding.

## Decision
Seed CI (coverage + link-check), add RTM skeleton, and adopt ADR hygiene to document decisions and guard against drift.

## Consequences
- Visibility into coverage and doc link health via required checks.
- Clear traceability for future decisions and releases.

# ADR 004: LUnit tests

Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-11-10
Decision Owners: TBD

## Context
See System Definition.

## Decision
See ADR text in previous cycle; this RC retains the same decisions.

## Consequences
Traceable evidence expected in artifacts/ once integration runs.

## Evidence
- LUnit runner parity is covered by the curated Pester suite entries (RQ-0003 LabVIEWCli + RQ-0002 RunnerProfile), ensuring both CLI entry points and telemetry are validated.
- Additional RQ rows (Vipm/GCli) capture packaging-focused LUnit scenarios that feed artifacts consumed by this ADR.

# ADR 002: VI History Report

Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-11-10
Decision Owners: TBD

## Context
See System Definition.

## Decision
See ADR text in previous cycle; this RC retains the same decisions.

## Consequences
Traceable evidence expected in artifacts/ once integration runs.

## Evidence
- RTM RQ-0003 (LabVIEWCli) and RQ-0004 (ConsoleWatch) ensure history-report automation has validated coverage on both CLI execution paths and console event capture.
- Vipm/GCli coverage rows (RQ-0005/RQ-0006) prove that package history data is populated via hermetic tests before release tagging.

# ADR-0001: Adopt Multi-Agent Orchestration

Status: Proposed
Date: 2025-11-11

## Context
We need a lightweight, non-destructive curation flow orchestrated by agents (Root, Local, repo, Tests, Tools) to seed CI and documentation while preserving the LabVIEW-centric codebase.

## Decision
Adopt a multi-agent orchestration pattern (Root->Local->repo->Tests->Tools) with small, idempotent runbooks and GitHub Actions for coverage and docs link-check.

## Consequences
- Clear lanes for curation without invasive changes.
- CI seeds enable future coverage gating (>=75% line total; file floors for critical modules).
- Traceability improved via RTM and ADRs.

## Evidence
- PR #33 (`feat/runnerprofile-coverage-burst`) demonstrates multi-agent curation for RunnerProfile CLI/Instrumentation coverage, producing Cobertura + JUnit artifacts consumed by the coverage gate.

# Warmup-LabVIEW.ps1

**Path:** `tools/Warmup-LabVIEW.ps1`

## Synopsis
Legacy entry point that forwards to `Warmup-LabVIEWRuntime.ps1` so older automation can still pre-launch LabVIEW safely.

## Description
- Validates that `tools/Warmup-LabVIEWRuntime.ps1` exists and then delegates to it, passing through all supported switches.
- Normalizes `-SupportedBitness` (falling back to `LABVIEW_BITNESS`, `MINIMUM_SUPPORTED_LV_BITNESS`, or `64`) before forwarding.
- Prints a deprecation notice so callers migrate to `Warmup-LabVIEWRuntime.ps1` directly; all logic (timeouts, idle waits, JSON logging) lives in the runtime script.
- Exits with the same status code emitted by the runtime script.

### Parameters
| Name | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LabVIEWPath` | string | — | Optional explicit `LabVIEW.exe` path; otherwise resolved by the runtime script. |
| `MinimumSupportedLVVersion` | string | — | Passed through to runtime resolution logic. |
| `SupportedBitness` | string | `env`/`64` | Auto-normalized to `32` or `64` before forwarding. |
| `TimeoutSeconds` | int | `30` | Maximum wait for LabVIEW to start. |
| `IdleWaitSeconds` | int | `2` | Post-start idle period. |
| `JsonLogPath` | string | — | NDJSON warmup telemetry path. |
| `KillOnTimeout` | switch | Off | Allow runtime script to terminate stuck LabVIEW instances. |
| `DryRun` | switch | Off | Show parameters without launching LabVIEW. |

## Outputs
- Console warning identifying the wrapper.
- JSON log (when `-JsonLogPath` is supplied) generated by the runtime script.

## Exit Codes
- Mirrors the exit code from `Warmup-LabVIEWRuntime.ps1` (0 on success, non-zero on failure/timeouts/missing LabVIEW).

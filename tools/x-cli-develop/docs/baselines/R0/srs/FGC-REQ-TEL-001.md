# FGC-REQ-TEL-001 — Telemetry analyses track SRS omissions and QA regressions
Version: 1.0

## Description
Telemetry analysis scripts (`scripts/analyze_srs_telemetry.py`, `scripts/analyze_qa_telemetry.py`, and `scripts/render_telemetry_dashboard.py`) report SRS omission rates and render dashboards highlighting QA regressions.

## Rationale
Analyzing telemetry identifies requirement coverage gaps and quality issues.

## Verification
- Run `scripts/analyze_srs_telemetry.py` and `scripts/analyze_qa_telemetry.py`; confirm dashboards generated by `scripts/render_telemetry_dashboard.py` pass tests such as `tests/test_analyze_srs_telemetry.py`.

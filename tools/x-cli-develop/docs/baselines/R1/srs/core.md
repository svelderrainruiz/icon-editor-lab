# Software Requirements Specification — Core
**Version:** 1.0 (**Revision 1 baseline**)  
**Baseline ID:** R1  
**Date:** 2025-09-05  
**Owner:** LabVIEW-Community-CI-CD

### Conformance intent
This SRS is structured to conform with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018:
- §5.2.5 Individual requirements (atomic, unambiguous, verifiable “shall” statements)
- §5.2.6 Set of requirements (complete, consistent, feasible, ranked)
- §5.2.7 Language criteria (binding terms; avoidance of vague words)
- §5.2.8 Requirement attributes (priority, rationale, verification method, source, status, trace)

### Baseline policy
- **R1** converts the SRS set into the 29148 template (atomic *shall* + RQ/AC + Attributes), adds strict linting/consistency checks, VCRM, and Verified→Evidence guard.
- Future baselines (R2+) will reflect additional scope or policy changes, if any.

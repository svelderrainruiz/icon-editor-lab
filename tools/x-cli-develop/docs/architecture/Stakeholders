# Stakeholders & Concerns (42010)

| Stakeholder | Primary concerns (examples) | Measurable fit |
|---|---|---|
| CI maintainers | Fast, deterministic runs; no external deps | p95 ≤2s; no network/process exec |
| Developers | Clear commands; testability; local parity | CLI help accurate; unit/integration coverage |
| QA/Testing | Verifiability, traceability to SRS | RTM links Req→Test→Code; coverage ≥ policy |
| Security | No outbound network; sandboxed IO | IsolationGuard active; file writes behind opt-in |
| Release/CM | Reproducible builds; versioning; baseline | Semver tag builds; artifacts & checks attached |
| Users (pipeline authors) | Predictable outputs; stable CLI contract | Specified JSON log shape; backward compatibility |

**Quality attribute scenarios (samples)**
- **Performance:** A single CLI invocation on a GitHub-hosted runner completes within **2s** at p95 for standard commands.
- **Portability:** Same binary (per OS) runs on Ubuntu/Windows runners with **no additional runtime install**.
- **Determinism:** Given identical inputs/env, outputs and exit codes are **bit‑for‑bit identical**.
- **Security/Isolation:** **No network calls**; **no process exec**; file writes only when `XCLI_LOG_PATH` is explicitly set.
- **Observability:** One JSON line on `stderr` per invocation with required keys; size ≤ **4 KiB**.

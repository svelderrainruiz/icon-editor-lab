# Stage 1 Markdown Handoff

## Overview
Document the process for generating contributor-facing guidance using the Markdown helper script so future agents can reproduce the workflow without shell quoting issues.

## Key Tasks
- [x] Generate a draft from `docs/templates/markdown/guide.md.tpl` via `scripts/write_markdown.py`.
- [x] Populate title, reference links, and action items based on the current effort.
- [ ] Share the filled guide with the owning team for approvals.

## Reference Links
- Documentation: docs/templates/markdown/README.md
- Related Issue: N/A

## Notes
Add a reminder to include Stage 1 telemetry references when the guide documents CI deliverables. Consider adding explicit placeholder fields for `Telemetry Links` and `Contacts` in the base template based on this run.

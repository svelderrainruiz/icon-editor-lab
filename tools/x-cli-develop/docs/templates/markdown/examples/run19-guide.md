# Innovation Pilot Roadmap

## Overview
Lay out the phased rollout for AI-assisted telemetry diagnostics across Stages 1-3, capturing experiments, decision gates, and expected impact.

## Key Tasks
- [x] Generate roadmap scaffolding using `scripts/write_markdown.py`.
- [x] Define experiment matrix covering anomaly detection, predictive telemetry, and automated remediation.
- [ ] Review gating criteria with Stage 3 owners before greenlighting production pilots.

- Documentation: docs/templates/markdown/README.md
- Related Issue: #1210

## Telemetry Links (Optional)
- `telemetry/innovation/experiment-tracker.json`
- `telemetry/innovation/pilot-metrics.csv`

## Contacts (Optional)
- Owner: `innovation-program@example.com`
- Escalation: `cto-office@example.com`

## Approvals (Optional)
- Approver: Innovation Council
- Date: 2025-11-12

## Risk Log (Optional)
- Risk: Automated remediation could conflict with manual mitigation playbooks.
- Mitigation: Require canary stage with ops approval before expansion.

## Lessons Learned (Optional)
- Insight: Early sandbox pilots reduce Stage 3 disruption risk.
- Impact: Lowered recovery time during experimentation by 30%.

## Follow-up Owners (Optional)
- Action: Draft decision gate checklist for each pilot phase.
- Owner: `innovation-coordinator@example.com`
- Due Date: 2025-11-20

## Sustainment Plan (Optional)
- KPI Focus: Track false-positive rate and detection lead time.
- Maintenance Cadence: Monthly recalibration of AI models.
- Owners: `ml-ops@example.com`

## Notes
This roadmap reiterates the need for an Innovation section that captures experiments, expected outcomes, and decision gates. Template should include an optional `Innovation Roadmap` block for recurring future-looking documents.

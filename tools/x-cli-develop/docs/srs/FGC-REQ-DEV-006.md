# FGC-REQ-DEV-006 - Workflows declare valid SRS IDs
Version: 1.0

## Description
Each GitHub Actions workflow shall include one or more `# SRS: FGC-REQ-...` annotations. Every referenced ID shall exist in `docs/traceability.yaml`. The `scripts/verify-workflow-srs.py` script fails if a workflow is missing the annotation or uses an unknown ID.

## Rationale
Annotating workflows with SRS IDs links CI behavior to documented requirements.

Acceptance Criteria:

## Statement(s)
- RQ1. Each GitHub Actions workflow shall include one or more `# SRS: FGC-REQ-...` annotations.

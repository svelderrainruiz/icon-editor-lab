# ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 Trace — x‑cli

| 42010 Topic | Where addressed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stakeholders & Concerns | `docs/architecture/Stakeholders-Concerns.md` | Explicit roles + measurable scenarios |
| Viewpoints | `docs/architecture/Viewpoints.md` | Definitions & stakeholders per view |
| Views (Context/Container/Component/Deployment) | `docs/architecture/*.md` | C4-style Mermaid diagrams |
| Decisions & Rationale | `docs/adr/*` (index from repo) | Cross‑reference from views where relevant |
| Correspondences | `docs/architecture/Correspondences.md` | Consistency rules across views |
| Traceability to implementation/tests | RTM + tests (see repo) | Requirements→Code→Tests mapping maintained |

**Review checklist**
- Views align with scenarios; no drift between Context/Deployment.
- New decisions recorded as ADRs and linked from views.

# Using the Knowledge Pack

1. Fill `docs/knowledge/edition-map.yml` with your clause numbers (per standard).
2. Keep your policy/process manuals in `docs/policy/` (you supply text; cite clauses).
3. Author docs with short cites like: “(ISO 10007 — Change_Control)”.
4. When giving guidance, resolve cites using `edition-map.yml` and avoid quotes.

# ShellCheck excludes curated for this repository.
# Rationale:
# - SC1090, SC1091: non-constant or external 'source' paths; CI often lacks those files. We review such changes manually.
# - SC2148: files without shebang are intended to be sourced, not executed directly.
# - SC2155: declare and assign in the same statement is acceptable in our short scripts.

### Cross-Agent Telemetry Recommendation

#### Effectiveness
- Markdown template preview + sessions workflows added; badges and docs updated; analytics with thresholds in Job Summary.

#### Obstacles
- Initial dispatch name lookup; resolved via file-path dispatch; sessions will appear post-merge routinely.

#### Improvements
- After a few runs, codify frequent placeholders into defaults; add domain contexts as needed; optional aggregator badge later.
